    <description>The Vice of Despair is what a blackguard gains when they turn their back on the living and pledge themselves to the cause of undeath. By amplifying the negative energy already suffused into their souls, these blackguards command necromantic energies and undead creatures alike and use them as a means to whatever nihilistic end they seek. Such necromancers sometimes become death knights beyond the grave, often serving archfiends or other evil entities in exchange for dark boons and gifts of power.</description>

  <element name="Vice of Domination" type="Archetype Feature" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_DOMINATION_VICE_OF_DOMINATION">
    <description>Blackguards of domination demand submission from their enemies. They impose order by force whenever necessary, crushing resistance and making others do their bidding. Surrender on the blackguard's terms is the only hope for any foe. Those who fail to capitulate can expect to be crushed and displayed as bloody examples of what it means to oppose the blackguard's resolve. In the hands of evil, dominance becomes tyranny.

Most blackguards of this vice are former paladins of the Oath of Conquest. Not all evil paladins of this oath become blackguards, however. Rather, a conquest paladin becomes a domination blackguard when the desire to harm others begins to outweigh their quest to establish order. Enjoying the use of violent force to subjugate foes, as well as taking delight in the suffering of others, is a distinct sign that a conquest paladin has fallen down the path of darkness.

Despite this connection to the Oath of Conquest, blackguards of this vice needn't serve the forces of law. For example, a chaos-based blackguard that serves a demon lord might use this vice's power to dominate others as a display of their master's supremacy. With this in mind, non-lawful blackguards of domination are few and far in between, typically because some other vice fits their personality more.

Oath of Conquest Features

Blackguards of the Vice of Domination gain the same features as paladins of the Oath of Conquest. However, they needn't follow any tenets associated with that paladin oath.

A former conquest paladin may wish to continue upholding their oath if it aligns with their views as a blackguard. However, a blackguard of domination does not derive power from such an oath. Rather, they draw their strength from the negative emotions associated with their quest to establish power over others.</description>

    <description>The Vice of Fury is for blackguards who particularly enjoy violence, murder, and the obliteration of their enemies. Many of these blackguard of fury channels raw anger into the violence required for victory. In battle, blackguards of fury are wild killers, impulsive, bloodthirsty, and destructive. They answer every offense or injury with overwhelming retaliation, and their enemies receive little mercy. Allies can expect a blackguard of fury to rush to the forefront of any armed conflict and to bring foes to ruin as quickly as possible. Evil blackguards of fury allow the vice to rule them entirely, not just on the battlefield.

Oath of Vengeance Features

Blackguards of the Vice of Fury gain the same features as paladins of the Oath of Vengeance. However, they needn't follow any tenets associated with that paladin oath.

A former vengeance paladin may wish to continue upholding their oath, as it may align with their views as a blackguard. However, a blackguard of fury does not derive power from such an oath. Rather, they draw their strength from their anger, bloodlust, and destructive impulses, and not any commitment to the ideals of justice or order. Thus, rather than punishing evildoers for their sins, a blackguard of fury may focus their destructive ire against anything—and anyone—that stands in the way of their goals.</description>

You are invisible.

If a creature damages you on its turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you control the creature's movement and action on its next turn, provided that you aren't incapacitated on that turn.

    <description>If the Light Domain represents the beauty and joy of day and the Twilight Domain the calm and serenity of dusk, then the Darkness Domain represents the full submersion into unknowable night. Upholding the ideals of nihilism, secrecy, and self-reliance, clerics of darkness often reject their pride and material desires and instead focus on the pursuit of training and self-improvement. Acknowledging their insignificance in this world and yet refusing to fade away completely, clerics of darkness typically act as assassins, mercenaries, monster hunters, vigilantes, gatekeepers of knowledge, and other professions typically seen as &quot;undesirable&quot; or beyond the threshold of normal society.

Evil deities such as Lolth, Tenebrous, and Zehir are most known for being gods of darkness, but gods of trickery, illusion, or death, such as Mask, Sehanine, and The Raven Queen, may also extend their influence to the Darkness Domain. On a rare occassion, even a god of light might take on clerics of darkness, drawing on the power of the divine shadow they cast to create servants that can operate effectively in corners of the world that traditional clerics of light would normally avoid.

Darkness Domain Spells

Cleric Level | Spells

1st | arms of Hadar, hex

3rd | blindness/deafness, darkness

5th | fear, vampiric touch

7th | blight, Evard's black tentacles

9th | contagion, enervation</description>

Dirgesingers hold high positions in death-obsessed cultures. Serving as members of a secret guild or as part of a hierarchy of death priests, they are entrusted with the serious responsibility of composing suitable laments for the dead. The more important the deceased, the more sorrowful and moving her lament is expected to be. No one will remember the dead queen in a few short generations, but a great lament might be sung a thousand years hence.

However, most dirgesingers do not belong to any special hierarchy or guild. Instead, they are rootless wanderers who travel from place to place, wrapped in inconsolable grief from some personal tragedy. These sad wanderers seek to express their grief through songs that teach the hearts of their listeners the meaning of true sorrow. Some of these fallen bards want nothing more than for others to understand the depths of their loss. A few are sinister creatures who believe that, since joy has been extinguished for them, they must in turn extinguish the joy of others by using their powers to teach folk the folly of love, the futility of hope, and the finality of the grave. Dirgesingers of this last sort often associate themselves with powerful undead, serving in the courts of vampire lords or lich-kings.</description>

Regardless of its identity, the Dread Lord seeks to bring death and destruction to all planes of existence. It rules the living and the dead alike with an iron fist. Even if you are opposed to such a grim future, you wield the Dread Lord's power as your own, using it to further your own goals.

  <element name="Circle of Twilight" type="Archetype Feature" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_TWILIGHT_CIRCLE_OF_TWILIGHT">
    <description>The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle of life and death that rules over the cosmos. Their magic allows them to manipulate the boundary between life and death, sending their foes to their final rest while keeping their allies from that fate.

These druids seek out lands that have been tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy, haunted places devoid of animals and filled with plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath and restore life.

Circle Spells

Your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the spare the dying cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Twilight Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Twilight Spells Spells

Druid Level | Spells

3rd | gentle repose, lesser restoration

5th | magic circle, speak with dead

7th | aura of life, death ward

9th | hallow, mass cure wounds</description>

    <description>2nd-level Circle of Twilight feature

You learn to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. You can augment your spells and other attacks to drain the life force from creatures. You have a pool of energy represented by a number of d10s equal to your druid level.

When you roll damage for a spell or a melee attack while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can increase that damage by spending dice from the pool. You can spend a number of dice equal to half your druid level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the damage as necrotic or radiant damage (your choice). If you reduce one or more hostile creatures to 0 hit points with a spell augmented in this way, you or an ally of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you regains 2 hit points per die spent to increase the spell's damage, or 5 hit points per die if at least one of the slain creatures was undead.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.</description>
