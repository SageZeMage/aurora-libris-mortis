  <element name="Holy Lamp" type="Item" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_ITEM_HOLY_LAMP">
    <description>A holy lamp is a special hooded lantern that is fueled by holy water instead of oil, allowing it to reveal the presence of nearby undead.

A holy lamp casts Vision and Light in a 30-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 4 hours on a flask (1 pint) of holy water (flask). As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to Vision and Light in a 5-foot radius.

Within the range of the lamp's Vision and Light, undead can't benefit from being hidden or invisible.</description>

    <description>A slayer's crossbow is a special weapon that combines the properties of a hand crossbow, light crossbow, and climber's kit into one ultimate multi-tool. Its name comes the use of these crossbows, alongside silvered bullets and other special equipment, by monster slayers to raid vampire dens and lairs.

Slayer's crossbows (and the knowledge to craft them) can only usually be acquired from the reclusive monster hunters that are known for wielding them. The ability to purchase them or their crafting formula should generally only be unlocked after the party completes a short adventure of the slayers' choosing.

A slayer's crossbow is a martial ranged weapon. It deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit and has the ammunition (30/120 ft.) and loading properties. It also has the following special properties:

  <element name="Von Zarovich Family Sword" type="Magic Item" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_MAGIC_ITEM_VON_ZAROVICH_FAMILY_SWORD">
    <description>Commissioned by Count Strahd, this weapon is the family sword of the von Zarovich clan, symbol of its sovereign rule over Barovia.

Long ago, the vampire lord Count Strahd von Zarovich commissioned a weapon from a crafter known only as the Alchemist. Impatient with the work, the count infected the Alchemist with vampirism to give him the proper strength, endurance, and insight with which to create a sword fit for the von Zarovich family.

Strahd found the sword so perfect that he used it to decapitate the Alchemist—the man would never again create a work of its equal. The Alchemist's life force was infused into the Sword. Far more than a mere weapon, it became an entity unto itself.

Strahd might have placed the Sword in the tomb of his brother Sergei as repayment for his murder, or perhaps he gave it to Tatyana, his unrequited love. However it came to be, at some point the Sword left the land of Barovia.

The Sword is well aware of its heritage and the powerful icon it represents for both the von Zarovich clan and Barovia as a nation. The weapon draws strength from its own vampiric nature, equating its hunger with a need to spread the family's honor. It demands an owner who respects these needs.

The Sword is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to celestials, clerics, paladins, and other divine servants.

      <description>Commissioned by Count Strahd, this weapon is the family sword of the von Zarovich clan, symbol of its sovereign rule over Barovia.

Long ago, the vampire lord Count Strahd von Zarovich commissioned a weapon from a crafter known only as the Alchemist. Impatient with the work, the count infected the Alchemist with vampirism to give him the proper strength, endurance, and insight with which to create a sword fit for the von Zarovich family.

Strahd found the sword so perfect that he used it to decapitate the Alchemist—the man would never again create a work of its equal. The Alchemist's life force was infused into the Sword. Far more than a mere weapon, it became an entity unto itself.

  <element name="Tome of Shadow" type="Magic Item" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_MAGIC_ITEM_TOME_OF_SHADOW">
    <description>This thick volume is bound in a dark hide etched with elaborate silver symbols. The stretched-skin pages and tightly scrawled writing are bathed in shadow, even under the brightest light.

Maikedhon was a mage living in the Shadowfell during the time of the secret pact between the worshipers of Vecna and Zehir (see the Mirror of Secrets item). He created a number of artifacts related to shadows and shadow creatures, the most important of which was a great magic tome. The battle between the sects of the secret pact that swallowed Trebarra Kan also opened a portal to Maikedhon's tower, sucking his items into the world.

Maikedhon's items came into the possession of some survivors from the pact who were obsessed by shadow. They eventually met up with the shadowmage, returning his book in exchange for being tutored in shadow magic. Together, the arcanists tested the limits of the medium, exploring the depths of the Shadowfell. The students of shadow were eventually lost in a deep abyss in the Shadowfell, but the book was later discovered near the opening of the chasm. It did not last long in the hands of its new owner, however; the book finds ways to get rid of a wielder who does not meet its expectations. Over the years, it has appeared intermittently in the hands of a gnome merchant, a drow battle mage, and a human princess, but now it is once again lost.

    <description>This artifact is a flawlessly crafted, weighty two-handed weapon that shines with its own internal light. The opal pommel stone shines or grows dull depending on the sword's mood.

Thousands of years ago, the empire of Kortaja stood as a beacon of the divine. Toward the end of that civilization, the glass citadel and its deific armies were besieged by primordial forces. Kortaja's secret weapon was a set of seven fabled swords forged by the dwarf kings and wielded by the empire's seven greatest generals. In the last battle, six of the seven swords were shattered by the blast from a magic, primordial trumpet. The seventh weapon was lost in time. Deific servants have been searching for it for millennia.

The Sword is a magic, sentient greatsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 radiant damage to fiends and undead.

  <element name="Silver Mask of Kas" type="Magic Item" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_MAGIC_ITEM_SILVER_MASK_OF_KAS">
    <description>This solid silver mask is fashioned in the form of a fanged skull. It was originally forged for the exarch Kas by his overlord Vecna.

In a time long past, Vecna corrupted the blood of a deva and used it to craft a powerful mask that could aid Kas in his duties as the Bloody Handed. Imbued with a powerful sentience, the Mask was made to compliment Kas's martial prowess by supplementing his diplomatic and tactical skills. However, the Mask also had a secondary purpose: it enabled Vecna to magically scry Kas and see through the Mask's eyes, allowing him to personally view his warlord's battles and conquests. One apocryphal tale claims that Vecna also used this scrying function to watch for any signs of betrayal, and that Kas's discovery of this ability helped convince him to betray his master and take the throne for himself.

In any case, Kas abandoned the Mask and placed it an unknown vault some time before his fateful battle with Vecna. If found, its sentience still serves the will of Kas, but the scrying magic that remains in still allows The Whispered One to spy on its wielder wherever it goes.

    <description>This large platinum hand mirror is inlaid with jade and onyx.

In a rare show of unity, the worshipers of the deities Vecna and Zehir formed a secret pact. The combined group was the idea of its leader Trebarra Kan, a powerful priest who, by adeptly leading a double life, managed to become ordained by the temples of both deities. The revelation of his twin loyalties drew faithful from both sides, and the pact between them became both powerful and wideranging. Power brought discord, however, and a competition for allegiances followed. As his careful plans began unraveling, Trebarra Kan attempted to create a magic mirror that would bend insurgents to his will and drive others mad. At a particularly delicate stage of the item's creation, open warfare broke out between the factions. The mix of magical forces sparked a conflagration that enveloped Trebarra Kan and trapped him forever inside his creation.

  <element name="Jet Black Ioun Stone" type="Magic Item" source="Libris Mortis" id="ID_CUSTOM_LM_MAGIC_ITEM_JET_BLACK_IOUN_STONE">
    <description>A unique and powerful Ioun stone, this artifact appears as a pure black void, forever traveling in a slow, patient orbit.

For the most part, Ioun stones are not unique in their nature—any number of dark blue, pale aquamarine, moss green, and other colored stones proliferate throughout the world. Their creator Ioun seeks to distribute knowledge in all its forms.

Still, even deities are responsible for items they wish they could unmake. A unique and powerful powerful Ioun stone without copy or sibling, the Jet Black Ioun Stone appears as a pure black void, forever traveling in a slow, patient orbit. It is thought that Ioun crafted it at the behest of Zehir, deity of darkness, poison, and assassins. The lord of knowledge might have felt compelled to create the Stone so that Zehir could use it in the pursuit of understanding—even if that learning involved better ways to find and kill his victims. In truth, the Stone proved a powerful tool, often bestowed directly by Zehir upon a worthy follower to aid in a particularly dangerous assassination attempt.

Invested with a sizable portion of Ioun's magical energy, the Stone gained a semblance of self-awareness. After years of aiding in the murder of so many, the Stone has seen its personality become twisted and darkened. Its reputation has grown as well. It has become—however dangerous it might be to possess—a compelling prize for assassins.

When you use an action to toss the stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.

The stone cannot be damaged or destroyed by conventional means. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

While the stone orbits your head, you gain the following benefits.

While holding the rod, you know the exact location and type of all undead within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with an undead within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all undead within range. The undead receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them.

The rod has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast dominate monster (save DC 21), which affects undead only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that's not undead.) If an undead can see you when you cast this spell on it, the undead knows you tried to charm it. The rod regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended.

If you are not undead, using the rod's dominate monster property in the Shadowfell has a 10 chance of attracting a death knight, which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The death knight tries to recover the rod, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the rod, the death knight tries to deliver it to its master.</description>
